Refactor HTML and JavaScript for activities:
- Added global event listeners for back buttons and action buttons in script.js.
- Removed inline JavaScript from HTML files, replacing with data-action attributes for better separation of concerns.
- Consolidated variable declarations and improved code structure in script.js.
- Updated activity HTML files to enhance readability and maintainability.
- Ensured all activities utilize the new event delegation approach for button actions.
